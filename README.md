Development of a responsive WebSite for the Honeypot Project.
The server part is built with nodeJS and express, with a DB based on MySQL.
The client-side architecture is based on jQuery library and BootStrap framework, with a deep usage of D3 library for printing out graphs.
TODO: needed a subdivision of the various functionalities in different modules (that's what happend when your requirements change every day, one module with more than 1000 lines!)
